        <h3>SATURDAY, OCTOBER 24, 2015</h3>

        <p>
        It's happening folks, and you are the special ones invited to our mother land, where "nightu" (booking clubs like Circle but much more refined), soju shots, squirming octopus are loved, and belligerent people are passed out wasted on the streets at 4 am on Wednesdays.

		<br><br>There are other cool shit too, but the above are <b>main highlights.</b>

		<br><br>We are telling you long in advance so you can make your travel arrangements, and we are keeping an eye out for good accommodation deals in Seoul. Airbnb is pretty good there too.

		<br><br>We will send you guys pretty invites for you to put on your fridges, which will eventually disappear somewhere after you open and close the fridge door enough times.

		<br><br>Again, early enough for your plans. I see your FB pics of traveling to cool places just so that you can take selfies, so you have to come to Korea for our wedding.

		<br><br><i>For those of you that can't make it for legit reasons like pregnancy, crippling injuries and North Korean invasion, we totally understand.</i>
